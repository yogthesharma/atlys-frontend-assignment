# Linear Equations Solver

This project is a web application built with React that allows users to input, edit, and evaluate linear equations. The application validates user input, processes equations in sequence, and provides visual feedback using SVG paths.

## Features

- Input and edit linear equations
- Validate linear equations to ensure they are in the correct format
- Process and evaluate equations sequentially
- Render interactive SVG paths based on equations
- Dynamic error handling and visual feedback

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Validation

The application includes a function to validate whether a user-entered equation is valid. The validation function supports linear equations and equations with exponents.
